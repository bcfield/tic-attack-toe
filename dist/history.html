                Centuries ago a new king was anointed well before his time.
                His predecessor fell gloriously in battle,
                tipping the scales in favour of his people - but his wars were far from over and the new king was expected to continue this military reign.
                As towering columns of enemy smoke drew nearer on the horizon, King Eota awkwardly dismounted his armour-laden stallion.
                His war-hardened men quietly awaited instructions from their new commander.
                "Orders, sire?" begged a general to break the silence.
                Knowing his voice would tremble, the new king gazed bravely at the approaching horde,
                turned to his army and slowly dropped one knee to the battle-bruised earth.
                Extending two fingers he traced a pair of lines into the dirt, and then another to intersect the first.
                In the nine available blocks he illustrated his strategy using opposing symbols. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                King Eota, you see, was a complete bucket.
                Not only had he chosen to silently communicate his entire strategy to dozens of horseman and hundreds of infantrymen
                (or, by his own reckoning - more soldiers than he could count on all of his fingers and toes put together)
                using a diagram written in dirt no larger than the palm of his stupid, little hands, but his strategy made absolutely no sense - least of all to him.
                His generals, bound by honour to their king and country, nodded in solemn, false acknowledgement before being suddenly startled.
                The king had dropped his sword - well, it was kind of a sword.
                Earlier that day while examining the deadly masterpiece he had been awarded during his coronation,
                he decided that it was too heavy, too sharp and far too dangerous to be waving about.
                He immediately ordered a smaller instrument, dulled for safety's sake, and also that it be made of wood.
                His slightly pointy stick bounced a little and made the strangest sounds which many described as a "tic", "tac", "toe".
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                For many years, countless battles were fought and mostly drawn with an occasional (perhaps accidental) win or loss based on Eota's idiot strategy.
                The declining patience of a diminishing army demanded a tactical revision, which would come from the most ususual place...
            <p class="mb-4">
                While the army stood waiting for yet another predictable battle,
                a beautiful maiden with hair as dark as a moonless night, and skin as white as purest snow unexpectedly appeared from a nearby cave.
                Every soldier on the field that early, misty morning had their eyes fixed on the woman, their hearts filled with anticipation.
                She stopped, turned, and quickly returned to the cave becasue she couldn't remember if she had left the stove burning.
                A convincing number of soldiers also reported that upon entering the cave she was accompanied by several small-statured men.
                This has nothing to do with the tactical revision, but worth noting nevertheless.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The generals called an assembly with the king and realised that though the strategy gave little room for maneuvering,
                simply executing the moves swiftly may pressure the enemy to stumble.
                It was unanimously agreed that this new tactic be implemented and was confirmed by a final decree from the heaviest general:
                "Death be upon any storyteller who again shoehorns such a divisive conclusion into a mediocre story just to fit the narrative.".
                Eota had no idea what was going on and just continued to play with his pet rocks under the meeting table.
