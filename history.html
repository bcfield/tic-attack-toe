                Many hundreds of years ago a young king was appointed well before his time; expected to lead a powerful army.
                His predeessor fell gloriously in battle to tip the scales in favour of his people - but the war was far from over.
                As towering columns of enemy smoke drew nearer on the horizon, King Eota awkwardly dismounted his armour-laden stallion.
                His war-hardened men quietly awaited instructions from their new commander.
                "Orders, sire?" begged a general.
                Knowing his voice would tremble he instead gazed bravely at the approaching horde, grasping for composure.
                He faced his army and slowly dropped to one knee.
                Extending two fingers he traced a pair of lines into the battle-bruised earth, and then another to intersect the first.
                In the nine available blocks he illustrated his strategy using opposing symbols. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                King Eota, you see, was a complete moron.
                Not only had he chosen to silently communicate his entire strategy to dozens of horseman and hundreds of infantrymen
                (or, by his own reckoning: more soldiers than he could count on all of his fingers and toes put together)
                using a diagram written in the dirt no larger than the palm of his stupid, tiny hands, but his strategy made absolutely no sense - least of all to him.
                His generals, bound by honour to their king and country, nodded in solemn, false acknowledgement before being unusually startled.
                The king had dropped his sword - well, it was kind of a sword.
                Earlier that day while examining the deadly masterpiece he had been awarded during his coronation,
                he had decided that his sword was too heavy and far too sharp to be dangerously waving about.
                He immediately ordered a smaller instrument, dulled for safety's sake and also that it be made of wood.
                When it hit the ground and bounced a little it made the strangest of sounds which many described as a "tic", "tac", "toe".
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                For many years, many battles were fought and mostly drawn with an occasional (perhaps accidental) win or loss based on Eota's first strategy.
                The declining patience of a diminishing army demanded a new tactical advantage which would come from the most ususual place...
                <p class="mb-4">
                    While the army stood waiting for yet another predictable battle,
                a beautiful maiden with hair as dark as a moonless night and skin as white as purest snow unexpectedly appeared from a nearby cave.
                Every soldier on the field that early, misty morning had their eyes fixed on the woman, their hearts filled with anticipation.
                She stopped, turned and quickly returned to the cave becasue she couldn't remember if she had turned off the stove.
                A convincing number of soldiers also reported that upon entering the cave she was accompanied by several small-statured men.
